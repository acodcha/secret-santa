  subject: Secret Santa Gift Exchange 2023
  body: |
    You are receiving this message because you opted to participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange!

    - This year, the event will be held virtually. The event will start at 2:00 PM on December 23, 2023. You will receive a Zoom meeting invite from Alice Smith.
    - See below for your giftee information.
    - Purchase a gift around 30 $US in value, wrap it, and mail it to your giftee's address. The easiest way of doing so is through an online retailer such as Amazon, where you can select a gift wrapping option and set a delivery address.
    - Please make sure your giftee receives their gift before the Secret Santa event! Shipping can take time, so plan accordingly!
    - Do not contact your giftee directly, and do not tell them that you are their Secret Santa! Part of the event will involve a guessing game to uncover the identity of your Secret Santa.
    - Once you have received your gift from your anonymous Secret Santa, please let Alice Smith know at alice.smith@gmail.com.
    - If you have any questions, please ask Alice Smith at alice.smith@gmail.com.
